# Gyro_stabilizer
Gyroscopic device designed for stabilizing separate objects or  instruments, as well as for determining the angular deviations of  objects. According to their principle of operation, gyrostabilizers are  divided into direct, force, and indicating types. Direct gyrostabilizers are  devices in which the stabilizing properties of a free gyroscope are  utilized directly. Direct gyro stabilizers are used as roll dampers on  ships and as stabilizers for monorail cars (the weight and dimensions  of such gyro stabilizers are very important), as well as for stabilizing the sensing elements of control systems.
